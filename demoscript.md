# Demo Script gitStream

## INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE

* [https://github.com/linear-b/gitstream-demo-seeder/](https://github.com/linear-b/gitstream-demo-seeder/) is the master repo which pushes to [https://github.com/linear-b/gitstream-demo/](https://github.com/linear-b/gitstream-demo/) **so we always demo on a squeaky clean repository with fresh PR’s**. 

## Open browser tabs:
*  (draft)
* [Github](https://github.com/linear-b/gitstream-demo/) demo
* (optional) Demo app up and browser with [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) 


## Demo flow

### Pre demo actions

Running gitStream actions takes 1-2 minutes which is a little long for a live demo
* Add a JIRA ticket to the Quality PR Title (e.g. [JIRA-0001]. (We’ll show the label gets removed)
* Add a screenshot to remove the no-screenshot label from the Standardization PR. (We’ll show the label gets removed)


### Intro
* Show architecture (Github Readme)
* Example talk track: *Here we have a full stack application that is meant to approximate some of the challenges large organizations deal with. Different languages, standards, and contributors. We’ll walk you through how gitStream helps you achieve your organization or team goal, be it increasing quality, efficiency or standardization. Let’s walk through a couple of use cases. First, let’s explore a simple change.*


### Base Kit
* Open PRs > Base Kit PR
* Show slidedeck - Base Kit
* Example talk track: *We see that gitStream - through the power of AI - added an AI PR description and even did an AI Code review! Our AI supports any language from Assembly (A) to Z, okay, Y (YAML). We see here (show changes) that a new contributor made a documentation change. Very safe, with little risk of breaking anything. *
* Go over every gitStream action + **the value**
* End with _What questions can I answer?_

### Efficiency Kit
* Show slidedeck - Efficiency - [Tell - Show - Tell](https://www.2winglobal.com/blog/tell-show-tell-the-most-powerful-demo-technique) - e.g. summarize slide, show the actions in the PR, go back to the slide
* Example talk track: *As you can see by assigning experts and auto approving safe changes, we gain a lot of efficiency.*
* Go over every gitStream action + **the value**
* End with _What questions can I answer?_

### Quality Kit
* Show slidedeck - Quality - [Tell - Show - Tell](https://www.2winglobal.com/blog/tell-show-tell-the-most-powerful-demo-technique)
* Example talk track: *There’s a bit more going on here. If we want to increase quality...*
* Go over every gitStream action + **the value**
* Talk about JIRA ticket (added before the demo)
* End with _What questions can I answer?_

### Standardization Kit
* Show slidedeck - Standardization - [Tell - Show - Tell](https://www.2winglobal.com/blog/tell-show-tell-the-most-powerful-demo-technique)
* Example talk track: *TBD*
* Go over every gitStream action + **the value**
* Highlight you added a screenshot before the demo to remove the no-screenshot label.
