# Demo Script gitStream

## INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE

* [https://github.com/linear-b/gitstream-demo-seeder/](https://github.com/linear-b/gitstream-demo-seeder/) is the master repo which pushes to [https://github.com/linear-b/gitstream-demo/](https://github.com/linear-b/gitstream-demo/) **so we always demo on a squeaky clean repository with fresh PR’s**. 

## Open browser tabs:
* [slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17lV67HVajHcDN3iynzkOyzrZZ5xGJQeocqGA7tW9iPk) (draft)
* [Github](https://github.com/linear-b/gitstream-demo/) demo
* (optional) Demo app up and browser with [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) 

## Demo flow

### Pre demo actions

Running gitStream actions takes 1-2 minutes which is a little long for a live demo
* Add a JIRA ticket to the Quality PR Title (e.g. [JIRA-0001]. (We’ll show the label gets removed)
* Add a screenshot to remove the no-screenshot label from the Standardization PR. (We’ll show the label gets removed)


### Intro
* Show architecture (Github Readme)
* Example talk track: *Here we have a full stack application that is meant to approximate some of the challenges large organizations deal with. Different languages, standards, and contributors. We’ll walk you through how gitStream helps you achieve your organizational or team goals, be it increasing quality, efficiency or standardization. Let’s walk through a couple of use cases. First, let’s explore the Base Kit.*

### Base Kit
* Show slidedeck - Base Kit
* Open PRs > Base Kit PR
* Example talk track: _We see that gitStream - through the power of AI - added an AI PR description and even did an AI Code review! Our AI supports any language from Assembly (A) to Z, okay, Y (YAML). We see here (show changes) that a new contributor made a documentation change. Very safe, with little risk of breaking anything._
* Go over every gitStream action + **the value**
* End with _What questions can I answer?_

### Efficiency Kit
* Show slidedeck - Efficiency - [Tell - Show - Tell](https://www.2winglobal.com/blog/tell-show-tell-the-most-powerful-demo-technique) - e.g. summarize slide, show the actions in the PR, go back to the slide
* Open PRs > Efficiency Kit PR
* Example talk track: _As you can see by assigning experts and auto approving safe changes, we gain a lot of efficiency._
* Go over every gitStream action + **the value**
* End with _What questions can I answer?_

### Quality Kit
* Show slidedeck - Quality - [Tell - Show - Tell](https://www.2winglobal.com/blog/tell-show-tell-the-most-powerful-demo-technique)
* Open PRs > Quality Kit PR
* Example talk track: _There’s a bit more going on here. If we are on a mission to increase quality to decrease failure rates and rework, we need to be conscious of identifying code smells, high risk changes and missing tests. Let's explore how gitStream helps you do that._
* Go over every gitStream action + **the value**
* Talk about JIRA ticket (added before the demo)
* End with _What questions can I answer?_

### Standardization Kit
* Show slidedeck - Standardization - [Tell - Show - Tell](https://www.2winglobal.com/blog/tell-show-tell-the-most-powerful-demo-technique)
* Open PRs > Standardization Kit PR
* Example talk track: _As your organization grows, it's important to standardize your software development process. It makes it easier for developers to transition between teams and new hires to be productive. Also, it increases transparency: what was the intent of change, what was it for, an how can I trace it from ideation to production?_
* Go over every gitStream action + **the value**
* Highlight you added a screenshot before the demo to remove the no-screenshot label.
* End with _What questions can I answer?_
